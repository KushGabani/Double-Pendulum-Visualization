# Double-Pendulum-Visualization
Basically, a double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end,
and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.
The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.
This repository visualizes the double pendulum by tracking it's movement as in the real world.
